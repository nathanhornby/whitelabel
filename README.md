*This is a very basic extension that is only vaguely useful - for proper white labelling of the backend there are better options available!*

# Whitelabel
 
## Purpose
Customise the backend.

## Installation and usage
 
1. Upload the `/whitelabel` folder to your Symphony `/extensions` folder
2. Enable it by selecting **Whitelabel** in the list, choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply
3. Create a css file in your `/workspace/css` directory called whitelabel.main.css - populate it!
